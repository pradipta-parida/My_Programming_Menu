> JSON = JavaScript Object Notation

> It is a Data-represenation format

> Used to communicate data across the web. Commonly used with APIs and Server in order to store and transform information.

> Compatible with most modern languages

> JSON Data Types (6 types);

Type                                            Examples

Numbers                                     3, -5, 1.7, 15000

Booleans                                    true, false

Strings                                     "hi", "John", "Insert Words"

Arrays                                      [1, 4, "HEllo"], ["hi","Yo"]
(which are used
to store collection of data,
instead of just one piece of data)

Objects                                     {"name":"joe", age:27}
(which are collection
of key-value pairs)

Null                                        null
(has one possible value and thats null,
basically just means that nothing
is there and its typiclly what we
use if we still want to have a piece
of data but just have it be empty)
