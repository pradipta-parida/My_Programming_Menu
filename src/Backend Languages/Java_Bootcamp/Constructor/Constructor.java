/*Constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
 
  A Constructor is a block of codes similar to the method,but it does not have a return type.

  A Constructor must have the same name as the class .

  Java Compiler provides a default constructor,if there is no constructor in the class.i.e; All classes have
  Constructors by default.

  Constructors are invoked using "new" operator.

  We can have private,protected,public/default constructor in java.
