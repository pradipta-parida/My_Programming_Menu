> Quote - refers to an estimated cost of an insurance policy.
          It's a statement from an insurer or broker outlining the potential premium, coverage options, and other details of a policy,
          allowing individuals to compare prices and terms before committing to a policy.

> Underwriting - is the process where an insurance company evaluates the risks associated with insuring a particular individual or company.
                 (by evaluating your crdit history, criminal history, employment hsitory, previous claims..)
                 This evaluation helps determine whether to accept the application, what the premium should be, and the specific terms and
                 conditions of the insurance policy.

> Policy Issuance - is the process where an insurer formally approves and creates a policy contract for a policyholder,
                    following the application process and any necessary underwriting procedures.
                    This involves creating the policy document and delivering it to the policyholder, marking the formalization of the insurance agreement.

> Endorsements -  also known as a rider, is a formal document that modifies or amends the terms and conditions of an existing insurance policy.
                  It allows for changes to the policy, such as adding or removing coverage, adjusting the insured amount, or updating personal details,
                  without needing a completely new policy. Endorsements are legally binding and become part of the insurance agreement once issued and
                  accepted by the insurance provider.

> Renewal - refers to the process of extending an existing policy's coverage beyond its expiration date.
            It ensures continuous protection against risks and potential financial losses. Renewal involves paying the renewal premium and, in some cases,
            may also include a review of coverage and terms to ensure they still meet the policyholder's needs.

> Cancellation - cancellation refers to terminating a policy before its natural expiration or renewal date.
                 This can be initiated by the policyholder or the insurer under specific conditions.
                 When a policy is canceled, the insurer will usually refund a portion of the premium for the unused portion of the policy term,
                 depending on the specific policy terms and cancellation methods.
