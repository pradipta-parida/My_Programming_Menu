> There are different types of Deep Learning Frameworks fore different purposes;

    Keras, TensorFlow, Pytorch, Caffe, theano, DL4J, Chainer

> Keras which sits on the  TensorFlow, as they are very integrated. TensorFlow is a neural network.

> Neural Network- Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms.
                  Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain,mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.
