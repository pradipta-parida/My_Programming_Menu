> TensorFlow is a open-source library released in 2015 by Google Brain team for building machine learning 
  and deep learning models.

> Its based on python programming language and performs numerical computations using data flow graphs to build
  models.

> Features of TensorFlow;
    * works efficiently with multi-dimensional arrays.
    *provides scalability of computation across machines and large data sets.
    *supports fast debugging and model building.
    *has a large community and provides TensorBoard to visualize the model.

> TensorFlow Applications in Real-World;
    FaceDetection, Language Translation,Fraud Detection,Video Detection etc..
