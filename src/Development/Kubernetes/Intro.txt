> Kubernetes/(K8S) makes it possible to containerize applications/services and simplifies deployments to
  production.
  Deployment of the containerized applications into Production.

> Kubernetes is container orchestration system.Docker helps us to create container on any computer.
  But,if you want to create multiple containers on different computers/servers, you could use help of K8S.
  K8S allows you to create the containers on different servers, either physical/virtual.And all of that is done 
  automatically without your intervention

> Benefits Of K8S:-
  . Automatic deployment of the containerized application across different servers
  . Distribution of loads across multiple servers
  . Auto-scaling of deployed applications
  . Monitoring and Health check of the containers
  . Automatic Replacement of failed containers 

> K8S deploys containerized applications , and therefore it has to use a specific container runtime.

  Examples of some popular Container Runtime - Docker, CRI-O,containerd

  Such container runtime , for example Docker must be running on each of the servers, which are
  included in the K8S cluster.And main outcome is that K8S could be utilized even without Docker at all.
  We can change container run-time from Docker to CRI-O and vice-versa.
