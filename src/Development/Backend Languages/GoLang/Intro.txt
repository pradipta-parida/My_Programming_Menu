> Go is a Strong and Statically-typed Compiled Language.

    * Strong - type of variable can't be changed in a code, it will remain the same throughout the code.

    * Statically - all the variables must be declared at the compile time.

    * Compile Language - that you only have to compile the code and it will be converted to machine code
                         directly (e.g; C/C++). Go doesn't have a virtual machine like Java Language, which 
                         takes time to convert the script into machine Language.
                         

> GoLang is an open source Programming Language.

> Features of GoLang :- Flexible, Concurrency, Strong Security,Impressive Standard Library,Fast Output

> Real-Time Applications Of GoLang :
    . AI & Data Science,
    . Devops and site-reliability automation 
    . Used in micro-controller programming, robotics and games
    . Cloud based/ server-side Applications
    . Used in developing command line interfaces

> It is most popularly used in building infrastructure tools, such as kubernetes,docker and prometheus.

> A variable is a storage area defined to store temporary data. Variable can further be changed according
  to program needs.

  Syntax:  . Using var keyword
                var variable_name type = expression
           . Short-variable declarartion
                variable_name:= expression

> import "fmt" - formatting package and it contains a print function.

> Everything in Go is inside packages whether its a print function or any other function. We have to use 
  packages by using import, writing the package name in inverted commas.

> If someone wants to use script or your code, he can by importing your Go file or your Go package. So, it
  becomes mandatory and Go to put the code in a package . Here, we will put a code under the main package

> To run a Go file;

    go run <Go_file_path>

    e.g; go run "c:\Users\prparida\Pictures\My_Programming_Menu\src\GoLang\Demo.go"

> Data Types - It specifies the type and space alloted to variables or functions.
  
  Various Types of data types used in GoLang;

  . Bool Type : 1,0
  . Numeric Type : 2,5,7,8
  . String Type : Pradipta
  . Derived Type : Array Type, Structure Type,etc.

> Operators - It is a specified operation that is performed on the operands.
  
  Various Types of Operators used in GoLang;

  . Arithmetic Operators : + , - , * , /
  . Relational Operators : > , < , >= , <=
  . Logical Operators : && , ||, !
  . Bitwise Operators : ^ , << , >>
  . Assignment Operators : <<= , >>= , &=

> Loops- A loop is the repetition of a block of code that executes a control statement specific number of times.
  
  For Loop: Infinite loop, While loop
