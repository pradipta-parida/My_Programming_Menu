> To check path installed for Python;

> Python Interpreter:
   . knows how to execute python code
   . translates/interpret our program into machine readable binary code
   . a program that knows how to execute python code 

      Our Source Code ---> Python Interpreter ---> Running Code

> If we want to run Python in Interpreted Mode in the Command Line Interface to see how easy it is to write and run Python;
   . In Windows open cmd --> type "python"
   . In Mac open terminal --> type "python3"
   . It will open a command line >>> (3 angle bracket) in cmd
   . we can type our code such as 2+2 
                                  print("Hello World")
                                  name = input("What is Your Name")
   . exit() --> command will call the exit function and will exit us out of the Python Interpreter and then back
     into the terminal command line
   . exit --> This will entirely close out the terminal
