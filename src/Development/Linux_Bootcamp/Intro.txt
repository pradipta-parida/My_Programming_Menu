> Basic Architecture -- Hardware, kernel(Program), Shell(Program), Commands, Files and Directories(Folder-in windows)

> Hardware - CPU, Motherboard, Ram etc..

> Kernel - On top of Hardware, there is a program which is called Kernel. So, kernel program is capable of talking
           to the hardware directly. It uses device drivers. so, with the help of device drivers, kernel program is able
           to talk to any hardware. It can talk to CPU,to RAM everything.so, Kernel is the most critical component in 
           any operating system.

> Shell - Kernel is taking input from Shell. Shell program reads the Command(the Command file) and it transaltes the file code
          line by line to the kernel. So, that kernel can understand in the form of language which hardware understands. So, 
          kernel and hardware, both talk with the same langugae. so, Shell will be translating the code in the language which
          kernel understands. Kernel will then take the action accordingly. Shell program takes the input from users and application
          programs.
