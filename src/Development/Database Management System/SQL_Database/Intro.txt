> What is a Database?
   ~ An organised collection of data stored in electronic format.
   ~ Data ---> Database -----> We can . Access the Data
                                      . Manipulate the Data
                                      . Update the Data

> What is DBMS?
   ~ DBMS = Database Management System.
   ~ It is a system software for creating and managing Databases.
   ~ client/End User <----->              DBMS                    <-------> Database
                           (instructions to query/modifying data)
                           (will execute our instructions on database)
> Types Of DBMS:-
   ~ Relational- we store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships.Each table stores data
                 about a specific type of object like customer,product,order and so on.. 
   ~ Non-Relational/NoSQL-

> Types of Database Architecture:

   ~ File Server - Files stored in local system. For e.g; If we have an excel file and made a copy of it and shared 
                   to our friend . Suppose, we made some changes in the original file but the changes does not reflect
                   in the shared copy excel sheet.Basically, your system/server will act as a storage system and only one
                   person can access at a time.

   ~ Client Server - Multiple users are accessing the same information(centralized server).If any changes are happening in the information end, then 
                     its reflected among other users system.

> Introduction to SQL;
   ~ SQL stands for "Structured Query Language" which is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
   ~ Categories of SQL Commands:
      1. Data Query Language (DQL)-  Select
      2. Data Defination Language (DDL)- Create Table, Alter Table, Drop Table
      3. Data Manipulation Language (DML)- Insert, Update, Delete
      4. Data Control Language (DCL)- Grant, Revoke

> What are Tables in Database?
   ~ A table is a database object which comprises Rows and Columns.
   ~ Fields/Columns - e_id, e_name, e_salary, e_age, e_gender, e_dept
   ~ Records/Rows - gives complete information of a particular entry.
