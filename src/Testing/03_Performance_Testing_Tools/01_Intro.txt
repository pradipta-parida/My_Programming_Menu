> There are several ways to test the performance of an application;
  . Load Testing - users logged into the application as expected by client
  . Stress Testing - users count increases while logged into your application
  . Volume Testing - multiple users logged into your application
  . Endurance Testing - for how much time the multiple users are logged in the application
  . Spike Testing - unexpected events where multiple users get logged in.
