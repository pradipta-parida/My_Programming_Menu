> The Apache JMeter(Performance testing tool) is pure Java open source software(Jmeter is based on java platform),which
  was first developed by Stefano Mazzocchi of the Apache Software Foundation,designed to load test functional behaviour
  and measure performance.

> JMeter is used to analyze and measure the performance of web applications / a variety of services.

> Performance Testing - testing a Web Application against heavy load,multiple and concurrent user traffic.

> JMeter originally is used for testing Web Application / FTP(File Transfer Protocol) application. Nowadays, it is used
  for a functional test, database server test and API testing etc.

> JMeter Advantages;
    . Open-Source License            . Full multi-threading framework   . Support multi protocol
    . Friendly GUI                   . Highly Extensible                . Unlimited Testing Capabilities
    . Platform Independent           . Visualize Test Result            . Easy Installation

> JMeter Work in brief;
  . Create Request to target server  ➡ Server Responds ➡ Saves all Responses ➡ Collect and Calculate Statistical info
                  ⬇            ↖                             ⬅                        ⬇
           Generate Test Report

  . This Loop goes on

> What is Element in JMeter?
  . The different components of JMeter are called Elements.Each Element is designed for a specific purpose.

  . Here, Thread Group is an Element, under which there are lot of elements such as Samplers,Listener etc.., under which
    there a lot of sub-system such as

                                          Thread Group
                                                ⬇
          Samplers, Logic Controllers, Listeners, Configuration Elements, Assertions, Timers, Processor
