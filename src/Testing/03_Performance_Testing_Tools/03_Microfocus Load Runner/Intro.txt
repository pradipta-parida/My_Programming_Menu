> This is a Performance testing tool, which helps to measure performance related parameters for your application.

> LoadRunner Architecture -LoadRunner community edition consists of 4 major components - VUGen , Controller , Analysis , Agent Machine/Load Generator

   . VUGen - producing the script for Virtual User Generator(VUGen), which is an IDE(editor) that allows you to prepare
             the script which you want to run(can replicate/simulate application based real-time client needs)
   . Controller - allows you to apply loads on the VUGen script. so,once the users script is finalized, controller controls
                  the load simulation
   . Load Generators - creates instances of users like(different machines)
   . Analysis - controller creates a dump of results in raw form. All the information is logged into microsoft access database
                named output.mdb , the analysis component reads this database file to perform various types of analysis and generates
                graph to check for any errors/fault

> Download "Web Tours Sample Application" from Micro focus which we will be using as a Demo application to test/use LoadRunner.

> The File which we create in VUGen is called as a user script and named as <something>.usr
  .This to create one user instance with the activity you want to perform.

> Click the + button to add a new script

> Single Protocols : set of rules which basically your application is built upon
  Multiple Protocols : for application using multiple set of protocols simultaneously
