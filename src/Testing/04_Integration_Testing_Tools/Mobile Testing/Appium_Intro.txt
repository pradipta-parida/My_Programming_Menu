> Types Of Mobile Apps
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . Mobile Web App
   =================
    Web apps are not real applications,they are actually websites that open in your smartphone with the help of a 
    web browser.Mobile websites have the broadest audience of all the primary types of applications

 . Native App
   =================
   A native app is developed specifically for one platform.It can be installed through an application store(such as 
   Google Play Store or Apple's App Store).
   Example- Whatsapp, Facebook. This app can use all the system application's(the apps which comes by default with 
   your mobile)

 . Hybrid App
   =================
   Hybrid Apps are a way to expose content from existing websites in App format.They can be well described as a 
   mixture of Web App and Native App.

> Tools Available
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . APPIUM - iOS, Android, Multiple Languages, Without APK File, API Level >17, Sacalability, Parallel Execution, Real and Virtual Dev
 . Selendroid - Android, Multiple Languages, With APK File, API Level< 17,Parallel Execution
 . iOS Driver - iOS
 . Calabash - iOS, Android
 . MoneyTalk

 . Robotium

> Appium Advantages
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . Cross-platform : Android & iOS - can test native,web app,hybrid
 . Allows you to communicate with other apps, Ex: Whatsapp
 . No pre-compilation of your app
 . support for built-in-app : alarm,phone,calendar etc.
 . Any webdriver compatible language is supported : Java,Objective C,Ruby,php,C#: we just need language 
   specific libraries to work on

> Limitations Of Appium
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . For Android,No support for Android API Level < 17 (for Android v>4.1) if your mobile having less than 17 then 
   we need to go for Selendroid
 . Script Execution is very slow on iOS platform and Android virtual devices
 . No support for Toast messages : we can handle this
 . No parallel execution directly: we can handle using sauce labs.

 > What is Appium?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . Appium is a mobile web, native and hybrid software application test automation tool developed and supported by Sauce Labs.
 . It is open-source software automation tool which is useful to automate Android and iOS platform apps.

> Appium Architecture/ How Appium works?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . As Appium is an HTTP server(webserver wriiten in NodeJs),its perform pretty much same as Selenium Webdriver server
 . Appium works as a Client/Server architecture
 . To JSON wire protocol the communication will happen with session ID's only
 . Whenever the Client sends a request the server will create a session and it will send back session ID to the client so
   that the future communication between client and server will happen with this session ID only
 . Q) How come the server will identify which session it needs to create?
   A) Usually, the client has desired capabilities which we need to pass using which the session will be created.
      This contains application name, platform version,package name,activity name

> What is an APK File?
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . APK : Android Application Package
 . This is similar to .exe files which are used to install programs on windows.The only difference is that
   .apk files are designed to be used exclusively on Android device and you maybe required to download additional 
   files before you run the application in the Android
 . We can download apk files from various sites:
     - https://www.apk4fun.com/
     - https://apkpure.com/

> Why we are using them and what is the use?
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . As of now, we are going to test mobile applications means once after the application was developed, in Android it
   will be APK file only.So, to automate that application we need APK files, generally in real time we can get this APK
   files from the developer and for generic application we can download from playstore too.

> Real Device Vs Simulator Vs Emulator
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Q) What is real testing device?
 A) Testing on real device allows you to run your mobile applications and checks its functionality. Real device testing
    assures you that your application will work smoothly in customer handsets.

 Q) What is Emulator & Simulator? 
 A) Emulators and Simulators are virtual devices. A virtual device is not the real phone but software which gives same
    functionality as the real phone (Except few functionality like the camera).

  . Android Virtual Devices - Emulator
  . iOS Virtual Devices - Simulator
