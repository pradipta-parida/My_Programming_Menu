> Types Of Mobile Apps
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . Mobile Web App
   =================
    Web apps are not real applications,they are actually websites that open in your smartphone with the help of a 
    web browser.Mobile websites have the broadest audience of all the primary types of applications

 . Native App
   =================
   A native app is developed specifically for one platform.It can be installed through an application store(such as 
   Google Play Store or Apple's App Store).
   Example- Whatsapp, Facebook. This app can use all the system application's(the apps which comes by default with 
   your mobile)

 . Hybrid App
   =================
   Hybrid Apps are a way to expose content from existing websites in App format.They can be well described as a 
   mixture of Web App and Native App.

   we need to go for Selendroid
 . Script Execution is very slow on iOS platform and Andriod virtual devices
 . No support for Toast messages : we can handle this
 . No parallel execution directly: we can handle using sauce labs.

 > What is Appium?

> Appium Architecture/ How Appium works?
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 . As Appium is an HTTP server(webserver),its perform pretty much same as Selenium Webdriver server
 . Appium works as a Client/Server architecture
 . To JSON wire protocol the communication will happen with session ID's only
 . Whenever the Client sends a request the server will create a session and it will send back session ID to the client so
   that the future communication between client and server will happen with this session ID only
 . Q) How come the server will identify which session it needs to create?
   A) Usually, the client has desired capabilities which we need to pass using which the session will be created.
      This contains application name, platform version,package name,activity name
