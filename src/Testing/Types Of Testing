> Smoke Testing - is the initial testing process exercised to check whether the software under test is
                  ready/stable for further testing. It is also known as build acceptance testing.

> Sanity Testing - is a kind of software testing performed after receiving a software build, with minor
                   changes in code, or functionality, to ascertain that the bugs have been fixed and no
                   further issues are introduced due to these changes.

> Regression Testing - is a type of software testing which ensures that previously developed and tested
                       software application working in the same way as it was working before recent
                       code/configuration changes done.(testing unchanged features of an application
                       such as adding,deleting and modification/fixing the defect is not affecting the
                       unchanged features of an application)

                       Types Of Regression Testing:
                        . Unit Regression Testing- Testing only the changes/modifications made by the developer
                        . Regional Regression Testing- Testing the changed part/module and the impacted modules
                                                       (Impact Analysis Meeting is held to discuss the
                                                        modules that are impacting due to the changes)
                        . Full Regression Testing- Testing the changed feature and the remaining part of the
                                                   application(if developer has done changes to most of the
                                                   modules/root of a project,then don't go for testing impacted
                                                   modules ,instead without wasting any time straight go for
                                                   Full Regression Testing)



> Functional Testing - Testing the Functional Requirements/Features of the software is known as Functional Testing.
                       Functional Testing falls under the category of the Blackbox testing.
                       e.g; If the client clicks this button, it should open up the home page.

> Non-Functional Testing - Testing the performance of your software, the load/capacity they handle, how reliable
                           is the software and it also talks about the scalability of the software.

> Black Box Testing - Testing the functionality of an application without actually looking at the code.
                       e.g; The analogy goes like there is a box which is black, inside that there is code.
                       so, you have to test the code which is not visible to you
