> Vanity URL - A vanity URL or vanity uniform resource locator, is a shorter, more memorable version of a URL that redirects to 
               a website's actual URL.
               Vanity URLs are also known as custom URLs or branded URLs. They are often used in marketing to make URLs easier 
               to remember and share, and to improve SEO. 
               Vanity URLs can also be used to simplify the user experience and track the success of marketing efforts. y
