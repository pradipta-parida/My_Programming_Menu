> Spring is a java framework built to create an enterprise-ready application.It creates jar, properties and all packages
  for java related project. SpringBoot is a extension of Spring which allows developer to concerntrate on convention
  not the configuration part

> Benefits of SpringBoot:
  . Rapid application development
  . Managing the dependencies
  . Auto-configuration

> Maven is a build tool that helps in project management. The tools helps in building and documenting the project.

* Build Tool- It is essential for the process of building. It is needed for the following process;
              . Generating source code
              . Generating documentation of the source code
              . Compiling of source code
              . Packaging of compiled codes into JAR(JAR stands for Java ARchive).
                It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used 
                for aggregating many files into one) files
              . Installing the packaged code in local repository, server or central repository

> Maven is written in Java,C#,Scala,Ruby,etc. and is based on POM (Project Object Model).

* POM features;
   . POM is an XML file that has all the information regarding project and configuration details
   . When we tend to execute a task, Maven searches for the POM in the current directory

> The tool is used to build and manage any java based project, simplifies work for java developers.

> In Maven, while setting up a new maven project there is "Artifact Co-ordinates", which consists of;
    GroupId- usually the name of the company/domain
    ArtifactId- usually the project name
    version-

> To check maven version and installation;
    Step-1 : Check if maven is already installed 
            Goto cmd and type --> mvn -version

    Step-2 : Download maven from internet
               https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

    Step-3 : Extract the zip file

    Step-4 : Under System Variables --> New -->
       variable name : M2_HOME | variable value : C:\Users\prparida\Downloads\apache-maven-3.6.3 
       variable name : MAVEN_HOME | variable value : C:\Users\prparida\Downloads\apache-maven-3.6.3
       variable name : Path | variable value : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_251\bin;C:\Users\prparida\Downloads\apache-maven-3.6.3\bin;
                                                                          (OR)
                                               C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_251\bin;%M2_HOME%\bin;

  * (;) --> To append the path variable value of java and maven, or appending any upcoming new versions.

    Step-5 : Check again if maven is installed

> While compressed files are typically given a . zip extension, the Java community instead uses the . ear extension for Java EE-based enterprise applications,
  . war for web applications, and . jar for stand-alone Java applications and linkable libraries.
