> During 90's , the methodology being used was the Waterfall Model.
    . The Waterfall Model involves teams following a series of steps,and only going forward after the previous
      steps, and only going forward after the previous steps are completed.

    . It is best used in scenarios where the teams are small, and the project is expected to move in a predictable
      manner.

> The Waterfall Model - Disadvantages
  These are some reasons why the move to an alternative to the Waterfall Model was necessary:
    . Make changes difficult 
    . It doesn't focus on the end-user / client
    . The testing phase is delayed until most of the project is completed 
    . Measuring the progress within stages is difficult

> What is Agile?
    . Agile is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the 
      collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer/end user.
