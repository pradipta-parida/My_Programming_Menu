React is a javascript library that means its not as different as writing in html,css and javascript.

With Html,Css and Javascript we can create static files such as index.html, style.css and script.js .

But in React there is a build process(intermediate server) in between to convert the code you are writing into something
which browser can understand 

Open Terminal/Command shell type --> npx create-react-app hello-world --> this will create app named
as hello-world
