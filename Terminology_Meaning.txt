> How a Website works, in general?
  . A Website is nothing but a bunch of files that are stored on a computer that is called as Server
  . You can access these files on your computer using a browser like chrome/firefox and so on.
  . Your browser sends the server a request to access these files using the internet
  . Along with sending the files back, the server might choose to do other operations like storing any useful
    information that came along with the request.Server does this with the help of database
  . If you are writing code for what you see in the browser, you are doing Front-end Development
  . If you are writing code for what Server does when it receives a request, you are doing Back-end Development
  . If you are working on both server and browser code , you are doing Full-stack Development

  . Example of Front-end Development - HTML, CSS and Javascript are the basic building blocks of Front-end Development

        (Netflix Login Button)
        .HTML-is what tells the browser that there is going to be a Button there
        .CSS-defines the color of text and button
        .Javascript- tells the browser what action to perform, when this button is clicked
