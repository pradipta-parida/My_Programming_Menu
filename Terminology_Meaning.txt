> Software - It's a set of computer programs which will perform certain tasks.
             we develop software based on the Client's requirement.

> Client - It is a computer hardware device/software that accesses a service made availability by a server.
           The server is often (but not always) located on a separate physical computer.

> Server - It is a physical computer dedicate to run service to serve the needs of other computers.
           Depending on the service that is running, it could be a file server,database server,home media server,
           print server or web server.

> How a Website works, in general?
  . A Website is nothing but a bunch of files that are stored on a computer that is called as Server
  . You can access these files on your computer using a browser like chrome/firefox and so on.
  . Your browser sends the server a request to access these files using the internet
  . Along with sending the files back, the server might choose to do other operations like storing any useful
    information that came along with the request.Server does this with the help of database
  . If you are writing code for what you see in the browser, you are doing Front-end Development
  . If you are writing code for what Server does when it receives a request, you are doing Back-end Development
  . If you are working on both server and browser code , you are doing Full-stack Development

  . Example of Front-end Development - HTML, CSS and Javascript are the basic building blocks of Front-end Development

        (Netflix Login Button)
        .HTML-is what tells the browser that there is going to be a Button there
        .CSS-defines the color of text and button
        .Javascript- tells the browser what action to perform, when this button is clicked

> Platform - A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.

> IDE - Integrated Development Environment(basically an application that contains an Editor for writing code
        as well as Build and Debugging tools)

> Runtime Environment - A runtime is merely a platform for executing commands. Popular runtimes like JRE’s (Java Runtime Environment) and Node.js (a JavaScript runtime environment) process code and produce results.
  They do not enforce any development patterns,they merely run the code.

  Framework - A framework focuses more on best practices, i.e. the way you should write code.
  Frameworks are typically opinionated, designed to produce predictable outcomes. For example, the Express framework is an opinionated way to create a web server that runs on the Node.js runtime. Without this framework,
  it is still possible to create a web server from scratch upon Node.js….. but it can be time-consuming and requires you to know all the nuances of how a web server works.
  Frameworks are often used to fill knowledge gaps or simply make developers more efficient by providing reliable/predictable outcomes.

  =================================================================================================================
    Framework,is like the foundation upon which           Libraries provide developers with predefined functions  
    developers build applications for specific            and classes to make their work easier and boost the 
    platforms.                                            development process.
